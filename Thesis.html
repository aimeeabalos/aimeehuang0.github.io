								Sixth Mass Extinction
							</b>
							<br><br>
							“The populations of nearly 9,000 vertebrate species, including mammals such as cheetahs, lions and giraffes, have significantly declined between 1900 and 2015. Almost 200 species have gone extinct in the past 100 years alone — a rate of two per year. The study says the losses are indicative of the planet's “ongoing six major extinction events” and has cascading consequences for human life on Earth.”

								Extinction Countdown
							</b>
							<br><br>
							"Extinction data revealed a rate of 100 to 1,000 species lost per million per year, mostly due to human-caused habitat destruction and climate change."

								De-extinction: Bringing Extinct Species Back to Life.
							</b>
							<br><br>
							1. Backbreeding: finding living species that have traits similar to the extinct species
							<br>
							2. Cloning: Scientists take a preserved cell from a recently extinct animal and extract the nucleus.
							<br>
							3. Genetic engineering: Researchers would line up the genome of an extinct animal with that of its closest living relative.

								Centralized to Distributed Storage
							</b>
							<br><br>
							"Everything, that happens to data, whether transport, processing or storage of data is entered into the blockchain. Afterwards what happened to data, who accessed the data, where it went and how that data was governed can be verified by anyone who has access to the blockchain. In essence the blockchain freezes the compute platform in time and  users of the platform can verify that the platform is in the correct state in real-time. 
							<br><br>
							It would transform our society from one that is trust based to one that is truth based,"

							<br>
							"There are two kinds of shopping: online shopping and shopping in person. VR and AR aim to close the gap between these shopping experiences. Shopping in person is great because you can try things on, but it expends a lot of energy. Shopping online is less hassle, but you can’t try on the item and sometimes you have to send things back.

Leveraging sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, mobile communications, big data and more technologies, the IoT would allow more and more useful information to be derived from more and more interconnected elements than ever before possible."
