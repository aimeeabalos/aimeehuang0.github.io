								Sixth Mass Extinction
							</b>
							<br><br>
							“The populations of nearly 9,000 vertebrate species, including mammals such as cheetahs, lions and giraffes, have significantly declined between 1900 and 2015. Almost 200 species have gone extinct in the past 100 years alone — a rate of two per year. The study says the losses are indicative of the planet's “ongoing six major extinction events” and has cascading consequences for human life on Earth.”

								De-extinction: Bringing Extinct Species Back to Life.
							</b>
							<br><br>
							1. Backbreeding: finding living species that have traits similar to the extinct species
							<br>
							2. Cloning: Scientists take a preserved cell from a recently extinct animal and extract the nucleus.
							<br>
							3. Genetic engineering: Researchers would line up the genome of an extinct animal with that of its closest living relative.
