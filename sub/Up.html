                    Today, our phone become as an extension of our body. Life becomes so convenient with the help of mobile phone. Despite the concerns and issues that mobile phone brings, we should admit that we are having a hard time to separate yourself with our  smart phone. In my opinion, using the smartphone is not a harmful thing, even though we are complaining that mobile phone are destroying human interaction. The main problem is to reduce smartphone addiction/overuse.

                             Watching people walking in the street, people tend to look down. And some reasons maybe because of they are introverts who are only shy. But most of what we see are those people who use smartphone.

                            <p>As we are in digital age where our time is mostly with our electronic devices, technology is blamed for being the main causes of the bad posture problem. According to the American Chiropractic Association, people already have a hard time to maintain a proper posture on their daily task. As they start to use devices and look at the screens, they will easily lean ahead and maintain this bad posture for a long time. Just simply watch yourself when reading this paper, most of you would find yourself hunched over. You may think this is the comfortable position that can be maintained to do the remaining work. But, being too lazy to correct the posture will lead to various severe side effects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            “Text Neck” is a new health condition formed in technology era. The time when we lean our head when using mobile devices puts a great risk for developing text neck. Dr. Dean Fisherman in Text Neck Institute describe “Text Neck” as the stress on the body by leaning the head when holding electronic devices in an improper position. The tilt of the head is also correlated with the spinal pressure.
