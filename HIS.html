							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">For this project, the team has developed a Hospital Information System for Manila General Hospital. This was brought by the problem that the team saw hospital's inability to utilize patient information for medical care. Often times, the hospital has redundant information and processes because they counldn't retrieve patient information at one. This is caused by the duplication of records per patient, misplaced patient charts, and delayed retrieval of patient records.<br><br>
							The system the team developed shall handle the processes necessary to aid this problem. The system automatically generates a patient number for every new patient that is to be admitted. If a record of the patient already exists, the system shall assign the patient his old number. This way, duplication of patient records is now avoided and prevented. Aside from this, the system shall also track everything that happens to the patient during his stay in the hospital, making it easier for the doctors and nurses to see his progress.<br><br>
							We believe that system can aid the problems of the hospital. With the use of the system, the nurses and the doctors would not have difficulties in retrieving the patient information that they need. Furthermore, the system shall help them in handling their patients and making sure that both their personnel and their patients would have easily in the processes.

							<h2>Systems  Development  Methodology</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">
								The project team has chosen the Agile Methodology for it contains highly iterative development in providing quality services. Since customers (in this case, the patients) are given the highest priority first, continuous feedback are given importance for the reason that there can be frequent changes in the needs of the hospital as time passes by. And this methodology is used In order to come up with a system that fits the hospital's needs.

							<h2>Scope & Limitations</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">
								The  project  will  only  deal  with  some  of  the  admission  process  of  the  patient  inside  the hospital which  includes the admitting section, PhilHealth section, laboratory department, billing  section  and  records  section.  Beginning  from  the  admitting  section,  it  will  start from the moment when the patient is admitted. Next, the patient will go to the PhilHealth section  for  the  confirmation  of  the  admission  process.  And  after  admission,  the  patient will  be  guided  to the  wards  for  his  treatment.  During  his  stay  at the  hospital,  he  may  be required  to take  the  radiology  and  pathology  examinations  in the  laboratory  department. Under the pathology examination, there are different services which are  cross  matching, fecalysis, urinalysis, hematology, chemistry, serology and blood typing. For the radiology examination, there are X-Ray, Ultrasound and 2D Echo services.  In addition, the patient may  have to procure medicines at the pharmacy department. 

								<br><br>
								After the treatment, he will then  be  discharged  and  will  proceed  again  to the PhilHealth  section  for the  computation of the billing. And  finally, the patient's  medical chart will then be brought to the records section for records management. That is where the limitation of the scope that the project team will focus on. However, even though the medicine procurement process is involved, the  team  will  not  include  inventory  as  a  part  of  the  system. And  even  though  there  is  a brief  discussion  about  the  radiology  and  pathology  process,  the  processes  that  occur within  these  departments  will  not  be  included  in  the  system.  It  will  only  serve  as  the sender  and  receiver  of  forms  and  reports.  It  will  also  be the  same  for the  administration department.

							<h2>Objectives</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">
							This system aims to make the hospital's employee do their duty or tasks better by providing a system which allows centralized access to the departments involved in our scope and render patient a better health service.
							<br><br>
							1. Allow communication between departments <br>
							2. Save storage space by having electronic forms and reports.<br>
							3. Reduce the occurrence of data redundancy in the medical charts.<br> 4. Manage records by adding, editing, and deleting the patient’s records. <br>
							5. Provide data access to department who needs only the specific information. <br>
							6. Lessen the chance of misinterpretation of medical records in penmanship recognition. <br>
							7. Lessen the time of processing the discharge process of a patient<br>
							8. Generate up-to-date backup files in case corruption of files happens

							<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
							<p style="text-align:justify">
							1. <b>Training:</b> The users shall be trained in using the system that will be implemented.  Aside from the actual  training,  help  videos  and  other  tools  may  also  be  presented  to  them  before  the actual training starts.<br>
							2. <b>System Conversion:</b> Direct  Cutover  method  is  the  best way to implement the system we have developed for the hospital. Direct Cutover means that  the  old  system  shall  be  immediately  replaced  by  the  new  one.  The  entire  hospital shall adapt the new system all at the same time.<br>
							3. <b>Data Conversion:</b> The  group  may  create  a  mini  program  that  could read  their  existing  Excel files; however, there will still be a need for information to be input manually. In order to input  all  existing  records,  the  hospital  may  designate  a  specific  group  to  input  the  data during  their  shift.  <br>
